Robpy: A Python Library for Robust Statistics
===============================================

Robpy is a Python library for robust statistics. 
It is a collection of functions and classes that are useful for robust statistical analysis. 
The library is designed to be easy to use and to provide a wide range of functionality. 
It is built on top of the popular NumPy, SciPy and Scikit-learn libraries, and is designed to be compatible with them.

Many of the methods have equivalent or similar implementation in the R packages `robustbase` and `cellWise`.

The structure and inner workings of the package are described in
